        <p>
          I am experienced in the production, testing and application of reusable components as part of complex frontend projects. 
          More importantly, I have a thirst for knowledge and an aptitude for applying it in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work has principally comprised the development of reusable components using Angular and React.
          I have extensive experience of the Material UI library, as well as in state management through RxJS (Angular), and React Redux.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, I have CSS expertise in SCSS and BEM, with experience in utilising the Tailwind Post-Processor.
